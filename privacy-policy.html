<h4>1. <strong>What is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>GDPR is designed to unify data privacy requirements across the European Union (EU). If you market to or process the information of EU Data Subjects – which include end users, customers and employees – a company needs to conform to GDPR to continue conducting business. </li>
 	<li></li>
 	<li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong>. This is a very helpful for companies to consider when deciding if they need GDPR consent as their legal basis to store and process data. For paying customers with whom there is a clear relationship then legitimate interest may suffice. PECR/ePrivacy compliance is important too and all Norton Medical websites are secure compliant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Your company information is securely stored at Norton Medical Industries main office.</li>
 	<li></li>

 	<li>We use clear, plain language that is easy to understand.</li>
 	<li>We specify why we want the data and what we’re going to do with it.</li>
 	<li>We give individual (‘granular’) options to consent separately to different purposes and types of processing.</li>
 	<li>We name our organization Norton Medical Industry and any third party companies such as laboratories and collection who will be relying on the consent.</li>
 	<li>We tell individuals they can withdraw their consent.</li>
 	<li>We ensure that individuals can refuse to consent without detriment.</li>
 	<li>We avoid making consent a precondition of a service.</li>
